Here are some ideas I have that probably aren't worthy of a full research project (or I don't have the expertise to do them) but I think are interesting.

## Markets
* Calibration of prediction markets
    * Prediction markets have become very popular in the past couple years. Are they actually calibrated? At what time horizons? How do they compare to general prediction tools?
* How to evaluate investment portfolio strategies
    * Is there a way to establish statistical significance of A vs B strategy?
    * What is the null distribution of returns? How can we construct a null distribution of strategies?
    * Should we use the integral between A and B as a metric? Should we only use a single point? What time horizons should we use?


## Personal/Random
* Analyzing songs through embedding APIs and/or SAEs
    * What themes are most important in different song genres?
* Analyze my own bike trips
    * I have lots of Strava data


## Social Choice and Economics
* How can we aggregate human preferences?
    * How can we align ML systems if we can't aggregate human preferences properly?


## Biology and Health
* What is the entropy of the human genome?
* Do people actually make better decisions when given calibrated advice? Do doctors? Should we only use calibrated models in clinical decision making?
* What is the full distribution of SNP effect sizes? Are there ways to collect and interpret SNP effect sizes without using linear models?
* How can we assess if polygenic risk scores are actually useful? If we tell people their PRS and high-risk individuals don't develop disease X (e.g., a cardiovascular disease), is it because the PRS was wrong or because they positively changed their behavior?
* For a long time, bulk RNA-seq was the gold standard for measuring gene expression. After that came single-cell RNA-seq. Now we have access to spatial transcriptomics. If we could design a new method for measuring gene expression (without any constraints), what measurements should we prioritize?
