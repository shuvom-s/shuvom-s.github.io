I am a Computer Science PhD student at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/). Broadly, I am interested in evaluation and measurement of and with ML, especially in health and biomedicine. To me, evaluation is a two-way street:

1. Develop and use new tools to evaluate human decision-makers and data. Some past and ongoing work includes evaluating privacy risks in "anonymous" genomic datasets [(link)](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/7/1101.full) and using ML to model sequences of clinical decisions.
2. Develop new metrics and methods to analyze ML systems themselves. Given thorny issues in our data — noisy labels, sparse labels, and so on — it is unsurprising that evaluations of performance are often unreliable. On this front, I've been investigating how to use _unlabeled_ data to estimate performance of models [(link)](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11866v1).
