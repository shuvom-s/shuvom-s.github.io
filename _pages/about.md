## New website under construction (check back soon!)

I am a Computer Science PhD student at MIT CSAIL, advised by [Bonnie Berger](https://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/). Broadly, I am interested in evaluation, uncertainty estimation, and decision-making, often in the context of biomedicine. To me, evaluation is a two-way street:

1. Develop and use new tools to evaluate human decision-makers and data. Some past and ongoing work includes evaluating privacy risks in "anonymous" genomic datasets [(link)](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/33/7/1101.full) and building Bayesian models of clinical decision-making.
2. Develop new metrics and methods to analyze ML systems themselves. Given thorny issues in our data ‚Äî noisy labels, sparse labels, and so on ‚Äî it is unsurprising that evaluations of performance are often unreliable. On this front, I've been investigating how to use _unlabeled_ data to estimate performance of models [(link)](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.11866v1) and am more broadly interested in how to develop proper evaluations.

I am grateful for the support of the [Hertz Fellowship](https://www.hertzfellowship.org/) and the [NSF GRFP](https://ibm.mit.edu/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
